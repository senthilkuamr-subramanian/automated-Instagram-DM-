# automated-Instagram-DM-
This Python script reads Instagram usernames and messages from a CSV file, then uses pyautogui to automatically send each message as a direct message (DM) on Instagram. The user must open the Instagram DM page before the script starts. It simulates human typing and clicking, making it look more natural.
